            This figure shows the Survey and NEWS estimates of <b>Disposable Income</b> from 2016 to 2021 with 95 percent confidence intervals, if requested. 
            <br />
            The <b>National Experimental Well-being Statistics (NEWS)</b> project aims to produce the best possible estimates of income and poverty given all available survey, decennial census, administrative, and third-party data. We estimate improved income and poverty statistics by addressing bias from unit non-response, missing information and measurement error.  More information is available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/national-experimental-wellbeing-statistics.html">https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/national-experimental-wellbeing-statistics.html</a>.
            <br />
            All income estimates are adjusted using the C-CPI-U to 2021 dollars as discussed in <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/current-vs-constant-dollars.html">https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/current-vs-constant-dollars.html</a>.
            <br />
            <b>Money income</b> is defined as income received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, Social Security, union dues, Medicare deductions, etc.
            <br />
            <b>Disposable income</b> includes <b>money income</b> minus taxes plus tax credits, for both state and federal taxes and credits.<br />
            <b>Estimate</b> shows the actual NEWS and Survey estimates by year in 2021 dollars.
            <br />
            <b>Change</b> shows the year-to-year change in income for NEWS and Survey estimates (year t - year t-1)/year t-1.
            <br />
            <b>Difference</b> shows the difference in income for comparing NEWS to Survey in year t (NEWS in year t - Survey in year t) in 2021 dollars.
            <br />
            <b>Ratio</b> shows the ratio of income comparing NEWS to Survey in year t (NEWS in year t - Survey in year t)/Survey in year t in 2021 dollars.
            <br />
            <b>Difference-in-Differences</b> shows the difference in Ratio comparing year t to year t - 1 [(NEWS in year t - Survey in year t)/Survey in year t]  - [(NEWS in year t-1 - Survey in year t-1)/Survey in year t-1] in 2021 dollars.
            <br />
            All estimates are shown for household income at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile of income for the groups shown.
            <br />
            Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible. A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race alone). The use of the single-race population does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and those reporting Two or More Races are not shown separately. 
            <br />
            The Census Bureau has reviewed this data product to ensure appropriate access, use, and disclosure avoidance protection of the confidential source data used to produce this product (Data Management System (DMS) number:  P-7503840 (P-7526912), Disclosure Review Board (DRB) approval number: CBDRB‑FY25‑0280).

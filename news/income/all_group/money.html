            This figure shows the Survey and NEWS estimates of <b>Money Income</b> from 2016 to 2021 with 95 percent confidence intervals, if requested. 
            <br />
            The <b>National Experimental Well-being Statistics (NEWS)</b> project aims to produce the best possible estimates of income and poverty given all available survey, decennial census, administrative, and third-party data. We estimate improved income and poverty statistics by addressing bias from unit non-response, missing information and measurement error.  More information is available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/national-experimental-wellbeing-statistics.html">https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/national-experimental-wellbeing-statistics.html</a>.
            <br />
            All income estimates are adjusted using the C-CPI-U to 2021 dollars as discussed in <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/current-vs-constant-dollars.html">https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/guidance/current-vs-constant-dollars.html</a>.
            <br />
            <b>Money income</b> is defined as income received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, Social Security, union dues, Medicare deductions, etc.
            <br />
            
            <b>Estimate</b> shows the actual NEWS and Survey estimates by year in 2021 dollars.
            <br />
            <b>Change</b> shows the year-to-year change in income for NEWS and Survey estimates (year t - year t-1)/year t-1.
            <br />
            <b>Difference</b> shows the difference in income for comparing NEWS to Survey in year t (NEWS in year t - Survey in year t) in 2021 dollars.

            <br />
            Federal surveys give respondents the option of reporting more than one race. Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible. A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept). This table shows data using the first approach (race alone). The use of the single-race population does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches. Data for American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and those reporting Two or More Races are not shown separately.

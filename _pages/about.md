I am a research economist in the Social, Economic, and Housing Statistics Division at the US Census Bureau.  I received my Ph.D. in economics from The George Washington University in 2013.  I am a labor economist researching the use of administrative data in the estimation of income, resource, and wellbeing statistics, particularly focused on measurement error, nonresponse, and imputation.  I also research equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility.

Before embarking on the path of economics, I worked as a computer programmer and as a Peace Corps volunteer in a small Andean village in Ecuador.
